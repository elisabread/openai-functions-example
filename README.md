# openai-functions-example

Example repository of how to implement OpenAI Functions by using TypeScript.

## Description

June 13th OpenAI announced their new functions feature. Meaning that you now could use OpenAI out of the box to fetch additional data for chat completions. Note that OpenAI will not call the function for you. It will simply return structured data for you to call functions in your code. Basically OpenAI is used to generate arguments for your functions and to determine when to call them.
